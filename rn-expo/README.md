# Welcome to the Ditto React Native Mflix Example App for the MongoDb Connector ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Typscript, Expo, and React Native
- Xcode 15 or higher with Commnad Line Tools installed (Tested with XCode 16)
- Android SDK installed (v34 or higher) - (Tested with Android Studio Meerkat)
- IDE of choice (Visual Studio Code, Cursor, etc)

## Get started
To get started, you need to update the Ditto Service with your own Ditto App ID, Online Playground Token, Authentication URL, and Websocket URL.  You can find these in the Ditto Portal.  For documentation on how to do this, see the [Ditto Documentation](https://docs.ditto.live/cloud/portal/getting-sdk-connection-details).

Once you have this information, you can update the Ditto Service in the `src/services/dittoService.ts` file

```javascript
    /* 
     * UPDATE THESE VALUES WITH YOUR OWN VALUES FROM THE DITTO PORTAL
     * https://docs.ditto.live/cloud/portal/getting-sdk-connection-details
     */
    private appId = 'insert Ditto Portal App ID here';
    private token = 'insert Ditto Portal Online Playground Authentication Token here'; 
    private authURL = 'insert Ditto Portal Auth URL here';
    private websocketURL = 'insert Ditto Portal Websocket URL here';
```


Once you have updated the Ditto Service, you can start the app.

Because of how the current Ditto package works,  you will need to use Expo Development Builds:
- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)

The basics steps are:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app

iOS:
```bash
npx expo run ios
```

Android:
```bash
npx expo run android
```

## Building Release Versions

### Build Commands

The following npm scripts are available for building release versions:

```bash
# Build Android release APK
npm run build:android

# Build iOS for simulator (default)
npm run build:ios

# Build iOS for physical device (requires valid signing)
npm run build:ios-device

# Build both platforms (Android + iOS simulator)
npm run build:release
```

### Output Locations
- **Android APK**: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
- **iOS Simulator**: `ios/build/Release-iphonesimulator/mflixexpo.app`
- **iOS Device Archive**: `ios/build/mflixexpo.xcarchive` (when using `build:ios-device`)

## Installing Release Builds

### Android Installation

#### Using NPM Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Install on single connected device
npm run install:android

# Install on all connected Android devices
npm run install:android-all
```

#### Using ADB Directly
```bash
# List connected devices
adb devices

# Install on specific device
adb -s <device_id> install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Install on first available device
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

#### Manual Installation
1. Transfer the APK file to your Android device
2. Enable "Unknown Sources" in Settings > Security
3. Tap the APK file to install

### iOS Installation

#### Using NPM Scripts (iOS Simulator)
```bash
# Install on currently booted iOS simulator
npm run install:ios-sim
```

#### Using Command Line (iOS Simulator)
```bash
# Install on iOS simulator
xcrun simctl install booted ios/build/Release-iphonesimulator/mflixexpo.app
```

#### Using Xcode
1. Open `ios/mflixexpo.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select your target device
3. Build and run with Product > Run (âŒ˜R)

#### For Physical iOS Devices
1. Open the `.xcarchive` file in Xcode
2. Use Xcode's Organizer to distribute to devices or App Store
3. Or use Xcode's "Devices and Simulators" window to install directly

# Welcome to the Ditto SwiftUI Mflix Example App for the MongoDb Connector ðŸ‘‹

This is an [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) project created with [XCode 16](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode).

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Swift and SwiftUI 
- Tested with XCode 16 on iOS 18 and iOS 26 
- Xcode 16 or higher with Commnad Line Tools installed

## Get started
To get started, you need to update the dittoConfig.plist file with your own Ditto Database ID (called the App ID in the portal), Token (called Online Playground Token in the Portal), and Authentication URL.  You can find these in the Ditto Portal.  For documentation on how to do this, see the [Ditto Documentation](https://docs.ditto.live/cloud/portal/getting-sdk-connection-details).

Once you have this information, you can update the dittoConfig.plist file main mflix-movies folder.  Once you have updated the plist file you can start the app running it in Xcode.
